This is my physics engine. I started making it a while ago, originally it was just a simple app I made to do operations with vectors. I was doing it in Python. Then I had the bright idea to make a physics engine, so after time I went from vectors to simulating dynamics, and now I'm here.
 
So far I have implemented, vector operations, objects, calculating trajectories, calculating where an object is going.
 
I plan on adding collisions, collision response, momentum and impulse, inertia, friction, orbits/rotational dynamics, keyboard input.
 
Once I get my computer back I will port it over to my computer, re-write it slightly for windows if needed, and connect it to a glfw project so that I can make a game. After I'm done with this I might even try to make a game engine, or other things.
